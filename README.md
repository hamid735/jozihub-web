## Installation
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to get a development server up and running.

## Workflow
Work carried out follows these steps:
- The client decides what they want
- Praekelt meets the client and discuss the requirements
- Praekelt splits the requirements up into GitHub issues in the project
- Praekelt writes a scope of work about the requirements and give estimates
- Praekelt and the client agree on the scope of work and it is signed off by the client
- Praekelt add all the issues for the current scope into a GitHub milestone
- Praekelt completes the work and gets signoff from the client

## Current scopes of work
Here are a list of scope of works, their states, github milestone and total hour estimates.

Once a scope of work commences or completes, this file should be updated to reflect the state of the scope of work.

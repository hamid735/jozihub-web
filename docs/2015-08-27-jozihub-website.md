# JoziHub website updates
## Objective
Prakelet Foundation has been tasked with updating JoziHub's website.

This document outlines the scope of the work, the time in which it should be completed, its cost and the assumptions that were made.

## Scope of Work
### E-mail registration and confirmation
> Upon registration a customer should receive a welcome response to the person registered.

Github issue                                                                                           | Estimated effort
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------
[https://github.com/praekelt/jozihub-web/issues/16](https://github.com/praekelt/jozihub-web/issues/16) | 1 hour

Investigation into the current code-base shows that e-mails should be sent out.

Praekelt Foundation will:
- troubleshoot and diagnose why this is not happening
- update the content of the mail with supplied copy from JoziHub

### Database accessed
> We would like to be able to download the full database with just the basic information (name, surname, affiliation, e-mail address, mobile number only) onto an excel doc from the website or have it feed directly into a google doc so it can be easily accessed.

Github issue:  Estimated effort: 7 hours

Praekelt will:
- Enable an excel export of this data

### Menu changes - News to change to blog
> This should link to the tumblr blog. We will start to use the Tumblr blog for stories about JoziHub / press releases. Facebook and twitter will still remain the main source for up to date news.

Github issue                                     | Estimated effort
------------------------------------------------ | ----------------
https://github.com/praekelt/jozihub-web/issues/7 | 0.5 hours

Prakelt will:
- Change the News link on the website to the blog as directed

# Schedule
- Company ABC will deliver the project to Client XYZ by so and so date, providing weekly status reports and project updates. Define the task / project start and finish dates, timelines for different phases of the project and the various milestones.

# Price
- It should clearly define the project cost for developing the application, resource expenses, overheads, pricing assumptions based on fixed-fee or time and materials project, payment terms and schedule etc. You may want to take this course to get a basic understanding of financial terms.

# Key Assumptions
- This must define the conditions on which the project depends. For example, in this case, one assumption could be 'Delays in UX design approval from client XYZ will lead to project kick-off delays' etc.

# Acceptance
- This must clearly outline the inspection requirements, testing and validation processes, approval process, client sign-offs and acceptance.
- Once

## Work to be completed
The following items have been identified as needed to be completed:

### Email on registration
After investigation, it appears that the code should mail the client. This will be troubleshooted and confirmed as working.

3 hours estimated.

### Database download
> "We would like to be able to download the full database with just the basic information (name, surname, affiliation, e-mail address, mobile number only) onto an excel doc from the website or have it feed directly into a google doc so it can be easily accessed. Is it possible to add in the old database off the old site into this database so that we have just one database to work from?"

Still need to know where the old database is.

Into excel.

8 hours - 1 day

#### Menu changes - events

Figure out how this works. Possibly ask Simon.

> We need to add a line that says "if you'd like your event listed on the jozihub website please send the details through to rea@jozihub.org

Need input from client.

### carousel
